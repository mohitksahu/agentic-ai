    "## 📁 Supported File Types:\n",
    "- **CSV files**: Transaction data with columns like date, amount, category/description\n",
    "- **PDF files**: Bank statements and financial reports (automatically parsed)\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Important:\n",
    "- This system provides **NO analysis without your data**\n",
    "- All insights are generated from **your uploaded files only**\n",
    "- No sample or demo data is used - everything is based on your actual financial information"
